# NovelFulll Downloader

This project is a web scraper/downloader for NovelFulll, a website that hosts a large collection of novels. This Python script allows you to download images from chapters or an entire comic hosted on [https://www.novelfulll.com](https://www.novelfulll.com). The script can operate in two modes: downloading a single chapter or scraping all chapters from a webcomic.

If you want to download a single chapter, provide a direct link to the chapter. If you want to download all content, then provide a link to the webcomic's page. The script automatically handles pagination to find all chapters. See the [Usage](#usage) section for more information.

The tool converts downloaded images to `PNG` format, ensuring consistent quality. It can be changed to your preferred image format as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library
- BeautifulSoup library
- Pillow

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pillow
```

Or install them using the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) by typing the following command in a terminal window: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

After cloning the repository, run the script with command-line arguments to specify the download mode, target URL, and output folder.
